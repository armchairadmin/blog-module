# Blog

Fork of https://github.com/nuxt-community/blog-module, which has been archived for owner. I am preparing to update and extend functionality using Nuxt 3

Create a blog with nuxt.

## Setup

My fork is not yet ready for production, to use the original module, please follow the original instructions: (https://github.com/nuxt-community/blog-module)

- Add `@nuxtjs/blog` dependency using yarn or npm to your project
- Add `@nuxtjs/blog` module to `nuxt.config.js`:
  ``` js
  modules: [{
      src: '@nuxtjs/blog',
  }]
  ```

## Usage

Put your markdown articles/posts in `blog` directory in project root.
